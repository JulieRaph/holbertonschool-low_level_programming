# HOLBERTONSCHOOL - Low_Level_Programming

C is a low-level, general-purpose, imperative programming language. Invented in the early 1970s to rewrite Unix, C is still widely used today.C is a procedural, general-purpose programming language. It qualifies as a low-level language in the sense that each instruction in the language is designed to be compiled into a fairly predictable number of machine instructions in terms of memory occupation and computational load. In addition, it offers a range of integer and float types designed to correspond directly to the data types used by the processor. Finally, it makes extensive use of memory address calculations with the notion of pointers.
